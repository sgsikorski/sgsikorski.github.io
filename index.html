              Running is generally considered to be a highly individualistic sport where one
              can run at their preferences. This has been reinforced through wearable running
              watches that introduce a wide multitude of running related metrics to the user,
              during and after each run. This data contains valuable training information and
              trends that models can identify. Particularly, there exist overtraining trends which
              can lead to both acute and longer term stress injuries, sidelining runners for weeks
              up to months. Because everyone’s running data is vastly different, an adaptable
              model is needed. This is presented in the form of a Dirichlet Process Mixture
              Model (DPMM) that can dynamically grow and shrink clusters with more data and
              training iterations. I present a DPMM implementation for running categorization
              with a novel hierarchical and standard evaluation metrics to assess its performance.
              2 separate dataset partitions, random and recent, are used to check immediate and
              long-term predictive capabilities. DPMM achieves upward of 96% training and
              94% hierarchical accuracy on the tiered results, a 5-23% increase compared to the
              SkLearn baseline.

              finding the nearest constructed node. A new node is added pi/16.0 radians in the direction of the sampled

              Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have revolutionized the field of
              Machine Learning and consequently countless fields such as com-
              puter vision, natural language processing, and autonomous vehi-
              cles. While these networks achieve unparalleled performance in
              complex tasks, the black-box nature of DNNs introduce concerns
              regarding interpretability of decision-making, prediction biases,
              and security against adversarial attacks. Researchers and practi-
              tioners have looked to employ DNN verification tools to mitigate
              these concerns by evaluating the robustness of networks to expose
              vulnerabilities in models. However, verifiers trail in development
              behind cutting-edge models due to the rapidly evolving field of
              DNN research. Looking to close this gap, there have been growing
              efforts to improve verification tools by determining their applica-
              tions and shortcomings. This paper aims to take a step toward better
              understanding the strengths and weaknesses of DNN verifiers when
              applied to a variety of network architectures. In this paper, sev-
              eral DNNs are selected as benchmarks to determine the effects of
              network architectures and robustness properties on network verifi-
              cation. State-of-the-art DNN verification tools, 𝛼-𝛽-CROWN and
              NeuralSAT, are utilized to verify benchmarks and are compared in
              their abilities to verify networks effectively and efficiently. Parame-
              ters of networks such as the number of hidden layers, activation
              functions, layer types, and degree of perturbation are varied to
              study their relationships with network verification and verification
              time.

            <h3 class="mb-0">GPU-based Quantum Circuit Simulation Transpilation Optimizations</h3>
            <div class="subheading">
              <a href="https://github.com/sgsikorski/aer-peephole">Source Code</a> ·
              <a href="documents/QCOpt.pdf">Report</a>
            </div>
            <p>GPU-based quantum computer
              transpilation optimizations are proposed within a quantum circuit simulator.
              Quantum Peephole Optimization (QPhO) performs gate can-
              cellation and qubit gate clustering to reduce the number of
              necessary gates and reduce costly CPU-GPU data exchanges.
              It leverages single qubit basis state information that can be
              statically determined at transpile time. Using this information,
              two qubit CN OT operations can be eliminated or replaced
              with less expensive gates due to the control qubit basis state
              not activating the target qubit. Passes are conducted over the
              circuit until convergence is reached. Gate cancellation reduces
              the number of qubits unnecessarily being transferred to the GPU
              and can delay involvement. This approach is also extended with
              cluster circuit reordering techniques. To reduce the number of
              data transfers, single non-involved qubit gates can be delayed
              according to the latest used definition. This uses a line by line
              basic block representation of QASM2.0 code. Experimentation
              is done on a variety of 28+ qubit circuits that are the core of
              many popular algorithms. Transpilation time was not shown to
              dramatically increase while benefitting from an average of 10.6%
              (up to 23.5%) reduction in number of gates and 91% (up to
              300%) decrease in execution time over the baseline non-optimized
              circuit.</p>

            <h3 class="mb-0">Machine Independent Optimized C Compiler</h3>
            <p>
              For a subset of the C programming language, I built a compiler that scans, parses, builds intermediate
              representations, and optimizes the code.
              Scanner, parser, and abstract syntax tree (AST) are built using C++. 3 address code and all optimizations
              are
              implemented using Python3.

              <li>Scanner that finds syntax errors</li>
              <li>Parser that builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) Error recovery is implented using Wirth's algorithm
                so that
                after an error, the program will
                recover to find additional errors that are displayed to user.
              </li>
              <li>From AST, 3 address code is generated, which is machine independent, not control flow bound low level
                code</li>
              <li>Using 3 address code, our basic blocks and control flow graph are generated to perform optimizations

          When I'm not competitively training, I enjoy spending time outdoors as we are near Shenandoah National Park.
          I enjoy most types of music and am always looking for new artists to listen to.
          Some of my top albums include</p>
        <ul class="list-inline">
          <li><i class="list-inline-item">Imaginal Disk - Magdalena Bay</i></li>
          <li><i class="list-inline-item">Ants From Up There - Black Country, New Road</i></li>
          <li><i class="list-inline-item">Free Nationals - Free Nationals</i></li>
          <li><i class="list-inline-item">Chasing Waves - Vista Kicks</i></li>
